She told homeowners that 15 members was required to petition for Special Meeting of the Membership, but then once she was in court, stated that 25% was required (36.25) which was an argument designed to benefit only recalled directors.</div>

She was deeply enraged that an officer dare demand proper legal procedure in corporation electronic disbursements of money to her firm that she made foolish claims to DBPR in the process of having a fit.
Her assumptions were not based on any information I had provided to her, but rather was based on Oliver Morgan forwarding all of my emails directly to her as they have been working together since at least 2021 on Hacienda Del Sol condominiums as recognized in public filings contained in county clerk records. All of these director-management company-attorney relationships appear to suspicioulsly pre-date the legal revitalization of the HOA.

This makes a lot of sense now because the closed board meeting that inappropriately was hosted on February 6, 2025 where homeowners were not privy to 95% of the information that was not legally allowed to be withheld from homeowners as it was not about personnel or active litigation. At this meeting it became clear how this machine was constructed between Oliver Morgan, Sarah Webner, and Janelle Marazon.

If I didn‚Äôt know anything about any of these people prior to entering that meeting, I would‚Äôve thought that Sarah Webner was Oliver Morgan‚Äôs personal attorney. That‚Äôs how the zoom call went with her leading directors in support of Oliver Morgan as if they were long time friends‚Ä¶ It was a very bizarre experience almost as bizarre as having a closed door meeting that homeowners had to pay for that didn‚Äôt meet statutory guidelines for being closed door and having the majority purpose be to try to convince directors not to fire Oliver Morgan for non-performance and a laundry list of documented shortcomings.

                <div>Attempting to undermine the legally permitted written recall is indefensible as general association work. Despite multiple critical responses about WHO the RESPONDENT in the recall is, Sarah Webner intentionally lists Scott Davis personally after being told in her first filing petition response from the arbitrator that community members voting for recall is the proper respondent. This follows a tactical attempt by Webner and recall directors in coordination with Oliver Morgan and to try to frame and gaslight the community into believing that it's one person against the board when it's a majority voting interest of the community that has participated and showed their intent to remove these four directors.</div>
