<h1>🚨 Recall Vote Successful - Certification Improperly Rejected</h1>
<p>On <strong>April 25, 2025</strong>, Surrey Ridge homeowners overwhelmingly voted to recall President Janelle Marazon, Treasurer Erica Tirado, and Director Tom Franzen.</p>

    <h2>📢 May 1 Certification Meeting — Conflict of Interest Exposed</h2>
    <p>Watch the full meeting where recalled directors improperly voted to reject the certification of their own recall, violating Florida Statute §720.303(10). They also attempted to use HOA funds to retain legal counsel without board approval:</p>

    <h2>📋 What Happens Next? (Original Timeline - As of May 5, 2025)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>May 1, 2025:</strong> Recalled board members improperly voted to reject their own recall.</li>
        <li><strong>May 8, 2025:</strong> Deadline for the board to file a Petition for Recall Arbitration with DBPR.</li>
        <li><strong>If No Petition Filed:</strong> The recall becomes automatically effective and replacements take office.</li>
        <li><strong>If Petition Filed:</strong> The case proceeds to DBPR arbitration. Legal costs may exceed $10,000–$12,000 and will be paid using HOA dues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> DBPR overwhelmingly supports properly conducted homeowner-led recalls.</p>
</section>

<!-- CONTINUED CASE UPDATE -->
<section class="highlight-section">
    <h2>⚖️ Case Update — As of May 12, 2025</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ On <strong>May 6, 2025</strong>, the HOA attorney filed a formal Petition for Recall Arbitration with the DBPR on behalf of the recalled directors.</li>
        <li>✉️ Vice President Scott Davis submitted a full legal response and objection the very next day as the designated proxy holder for 81 parcels.</li>
        <li>📉 The Association’s D&O insurance <strong>expired on May 10, 2025</strong>, meaning all board members are currently personally liable for decisions taken since that date.</li>
        <li>💸 Legal costs are now estimated to exceed <strong>$10,000–$15,000</strong>. To date, at least <strong>$1,875</strong> has already been spent to resist the recall overwhelmingly supported by majority of homewowners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Next Step:</strong> DBPR will evaluate both the homeowner-led recall and the board’s petition. A ruling is expected within 10–45 days. If the DBPR certifies the recall, the recalled directors will be removed and replacements will take office.</p>

<section class="highlight-section">
    <h2>🧾 Financial Red Flags — Homeowners Are Paying the Legal Bill</h2>
    <p>The recalled board is using HOA dues to fund its legal challenge, despite overwhelming homeowner opposition. D&O insurance is expired, and no board vote was held to authorize this expenditure.</p>
    <p>💬 This has triggered concern among residents about potential dues increases, misuse of funds, and a lack of financial oversight.</p>
</section>

<section class="highlight-section">
    <h2>📅 Stay Informed — Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>📬 Homeowners will be notified by email and posted notices as soon as DBPR issues a ruling.</li>
        <li>🗳️ If the recall is upheld, replacement directors will be voted on by homeowners who supported the recall.</li>
        <li>💬 A community-wide update meeting will be scheduled after DBPR resolution.</li>
    </ul>

</section>

        <section class="highlight-section">
            <h2>⚖️ Warning: Continued DBPR Arbitration Costs</h2>
            <p>The recalled board members chose to file a Petition for Recall Arbitration with the DBPR by the May 8 deadline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>👉 It costs $200 for filing fee, exposing the HOA to an estimated $10,000–$12,000 in legal fees. Confirmed at 5/12/2025 meeting that already $1,875.00 has already been spent on HOA attorney using your money.</li>
                <li>👉 Defending a recall that complies 100% with Florida law would is virtually unwinnable.</li>
                <li>👉 Homeowners could face an approximate dues increase of $82.76 per household to cover these legal costs depending how much they spend to defend this frivolous case</li>
                <li>👉 Recalled directors may face demands for personal reimbursement if they misuse HOA funds on frivolous litigation, especially as Directors and Officers Insurance has lapsed on May 10th 2025.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Homeowners will continued to be fully and immediately notified when Association funds are wrongfully used to oppose the recall via arbitration.</strong></p>

            <h2>🛠️ Pool Reopened – Legally and Safely</h2>
            <p>✅ The pool has now legally reopened following a licensed repair, approved by the Florida Department of Health.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✔️ Plumbing repaired by American Veteran Plumbing LLC – a licensed, DBPR-verified CFC contractor.</li>
                <li>✔️ Cost: $295 (vs. $750+ proposal to dig alone by the former vendor)</li>
                <li>✔️ No trenching, no rerouting, no inflated costs</li>
                <li>✔️ DOH approved reopening after full documentation submitted</li>
                <li>✔️ Pool chemical levels verified: pH 7.4, Free Chlorine 7.5 ppm</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>💧 Water restored to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>🏊 Cabana restroom and shower</li>
                <li>🚿 Pool shower and fill line</li>
                <li>🌱 Irrigation (pending one remaining break)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The repair saved thousands in HOA funds and avoided a dues increase. All work was done transparently and lawfully under homeowner proxy authority.</p>
            <p><strong>🚨 Update:</strong> After the satisfactory inspection, President Janelle Marazon attempted to interfere with the Department of Health report by submitting photos and making false claims about unlicensed work. DOH officials Alan Dang and Andrew Halula rejected these claims and confirmed the pool remains open and compliant.</p>

Because he was missing this reagent the color on his gauge appeared lighter than it should've been leading him to believe that the pool needed more chlorine which it did not. It needed the opposite. I provided my contact information to Carlos and let him know what reagent was missing from his kit and was required in order to effectively take the proper readings. We also did a pH test together where he thought that a 7.0 was a good pH and had to be informed that the target pH was 7.4 to 7.6</td> <!-- Placeholder, user can update -->
