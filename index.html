<!-- CONTINUED CASE UPDATE -->
<section class="highlight-section">
    <h2>Case Update - As of May 30, 2025</h2>
    <li>May 12, 2025 DBPR arbitrator order requiring response to Respondent's answer</li>
          <li>May 14, 2025 Scott Davis filed supplemental response to Petition w/ Exhibits</li>
          <li>May 19, 2025 Scott Davis files HOA 6000-6 Qualified Representative Form
            <li>May 20, 2025 Attorney Sarah Webner files Response to Recall Answer, still asking for attorneys fees, despite the arbitrator already stating in an order attorney fees are not allowed an HOA recall cases</li></li>
          <li>May 23, 2025 DBPR arbitrator signs Order setting hearing for case management May 28, 2025 at 2 PM and request a journey and respondent have a pre-hearing conference to cover stipulated items</li>
        <li>May 27, 2025 Scott Davis confers with Attorney Sarah Webner on required pre-hearing conference call</li>
                <li>May 28, 2025 Case management hearing conducted at 2 PM EST</li>
        <li>May 29, 2025 DBPR issues preliminary final order, however, immediately vacates the order when he realizes Petitioner's defense FS 720.303(10)(c)1 does not apply and bylaws do not have to specifically provide that directors may be recalled at a meeting as this section of Florida statutes was created in 1991, after our 1986 bylaws, and our bylaws do not contain Kaufman language which renders future statutes like this one non-retroactive.</li>
        <li>May 30, 2025 DBPR issues Order vacating previously filed final order as 1986 bylaws pre-date 1991 Florida statute section 720 and with no Kaufman language invalidates Attorney Sarah Webner's defense claims while confirming the governing documents allow recall at a meeting, proxy format, and method used were valid, petitioners procedural objections do not apply, and our recall process was procedurally sound.</li>
            <li>May 30, 2025 Scott Davis files respondent's legal brief to DBPR in accordance with DBPR arbitrator order and requesting certification of recall (order grants 10 days to file, Scott Davis filed response on day the first day)</li>
        <li>June 02, 2025 Scott Davis files respondent's supplemental legal brief to DBPR in accordance with DBPR arbitrator order and requesting certification of recall. Sarah Webner slow to file a response with DBPR</li>
    <li>June 06, 2025 Sarah Webner files recalled directors legal brief to DBPR making new arguments 58 days after she advised via email that 10% of homeowners may petition for homeowner led special meeting, only to now, 2 months later attempt to argue that 25% of the community entitled to vote would need to petition for a special meeting. Herein lies the issue of dual loyalty in trying to be the association attorney as well as the personal defense attorney for directors, subject to recall, she has now both advised corporation officers how to conduct the recall as well as provided conflicting information in a legal DBPR case with an entirely different set of facts and defense due to conflicted dual loyalty that is 100% improper.</li>
    <li>June 06, 2025 Scott Davis immediately files a response to this brief with an exhibit outlining Sarah Webner's own email indicating that 10% homeowner voting interest met the threshold and they acknowledge that as the controlling value. Only after an adverse outcome of the homeowner led recall, 58 days later from that email are they now desperately looking to again find any reason to go against the homeowner will, and majority who pays for the dues that fund the association by funding ridiculous defenses with your money.</li>
    <p><strong>Next Step:</strong> DBPR will evaluate both the homeowner-led recall and the board's petition. A ruling is expected within 7-21 days. If the DBPR certifies the recall, the recalled directors will be removed and replacements will take office.</p>

<section class="highlight-section">
    <h2>Financial Red Flags Homeowners Are Paying the Legal Bill</h2>
    <p>The recalled board is using HOA dues to fund its legal challenge, despite overwhelming homeowner opposition. D&O insurance had expired, and no board vote was held to authorize this expenditure.</p>
    <p>This has triggered concern among residents about potential dues increases, misuse of funds, and a lack of financial oversight.</p>
     <p>Scott Davis is the only reason the pool has opened and remained open. He has taken the decisive and necessary steps to preserve HOA assets, protect homeowners amenities, ensure safety and security of the residents and all at his own personal expense as the board of directors refuses to reimburse him for the necessary and legally required maintenance of the pool and plumbing system repairs he had to front out-of-pocket. Directors (subject to recall), hold all the Bank of America signatory positions that control all disbursement from the HOA account and this position has been weaponized to prevent reimbursement for valid association needs such as keeping the pool operational and meeting Dept of Health regulations. Your funds are being used against you and any Board member who wants to help you.</p>


</section>

<section class="highlight-section">
    <h2>Stay Informed - Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Homeowners will be notified by email and posted notices as soon as DBPR issues a ruling.</li>
        <li>If the recall is upheld, replacement directors will be voted on by homeowners who supported the recall.</li>
        <li>A community-wide update meeting will be scheduled after DBPR resolution.</li>
    </ul>

</section>

        <section class="highlight-section">
            <h2>Warning: Continued DBPR Arbitration Costs</h2>
            <p>The recalled board members chose to file a Petition for Recall Arbitration with the DBPR by the May 8 deadline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It costs $200 for filing fee, exposing the HOA to an estimated $10,000-$12,000 in legal fees. Confirmed at 5/12/2025 meeting that already $1,974.50 has already been spent on HOA attorney using your money. My research has led me to reconcile that Sara Webner's invoicing runs 47 days in arrears so it will be six weeks before we even know what the recall board members are spending your money on and what kind of bills she's racking up on you're dime.</li>
                <li>Defending a recall that complies 100% with Florida law would is virtually unwinnable.</li>
                <li>Homeowners could face an approximate dues increase of $82.76 per household to cover these legal costs depending how much they spend to defend this frivolous case</li>
                <li>Recalled directors may face demands for personal reimbursement if they misuse HOA funds on frivolous litigation, especially as Directors and Officers Insurance has lapsed on May 10th 2025.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Homeowners will continued to be fully and immediately notified when Association funds are wrongfully used to oppose the recall via arbitration.</strong></p>

        <section class="highlight-section">
            <h2>Pool Reopened, Legally and Safely</h2>
            <p>The pool has now legally reopened following a licensed CFC plumbing repair Scott Davis had to pay for out of pocket so that the pool could reopen, which was subsequently approved by the Florida Department of Health and issued a satisfactory health report.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plumbing repaired by American Veteran Plumbing LLC - a licensed, DBPR-verified CFC contractor.</li>
                <li>Cost: $295 (vs. $750+ proposal to dig alone by the former vendor)</li>
                <li>No trenching, no rerouting, no inflated costs</li>
                <li>DOH approved reopening after full documentation submitted</li>
                <li>Pool chemical levels verified: pH 7.4, Free Chlorine 7.5 ppm</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Water restored to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cabana restroom and shower</li>
                <li>Pool shower and fill line</li>
                <li>Irrigation (pending one remaining break)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The repair saved thousands in HOA funds and avoided a dues increase. All work was done transparently and lawfully under homeowner proxy authority.</p>
            <p><strong>Update:</strong> After the satisfactory inspection, President Janelle Marazon attempted to interfere with the Department of Health report by submitting photos and making false claims about unlicensed work. DOH officials Alan Dang and Andrew Halula rejected these claims and confirmed the pool remains open and compliant.</p>

Because he was missing this reagent the color on his gauge appeared lighter than it should've been leading him to believe that the pool needed more chlorine which it did not. It needed the opposite. I provided my contact information to Carlos and let him know what reagent was missing from his kit and was required in order to effectively take the proper readings. We also did a pH test together where he thought that a 7.0 was a good pH and had to be informed that the target pH was 7.4 to 7.6</td> <!-- Placeholder, user can update -->

                <li>May 28, 2025 Case management hearing conducted at 2 PM EST</li>
        <li>May 29, 2025 DBPR issues preliminary final order, however, immediately vacate the order when he realizes there's no Kaufman language in our bylaws</li>
        <li>May 30, 2025 DBPR issues Order vacating previously filed final order as 1986 bylaws pre-date 1991 Florida statute section 720 and with no Kaufman language invalidates Attorney Sarah Webner's defense claims while confirming the governing documents allow recall at a meeting, proxy format, and method used were valid, petitioners, procedural objections do not apply, and our recall process was procedural sound.</li>
            <li>May 30, 2025 Scott Davis files respondent's legal brief to DBPR in accordance with DBPR arbitrator order and requesting certification of recall</li>
         <li>June 02, 2025 Scott Davis files respondent's supplemental legal brief to DBPR in accordance with DBPR arbitrator order and requesting certification of recall. Sarah Webner slow to file a response with DBPR</li>
    <li>June 06, 2025 Sarah Webner files recalled directors legal brief to DBPR making new arguments 58 days after she advised via email that 10% of homeowners may petition for homeowner led special meeting, only to now, 2 months later attempt to argue that 25% of the community entitled to vote would need to petition for a special meeting. Herein lies the issue of dual loyalty in trying to be the association attorney as well as the personal defense attorney for directors, subject to recall, she has now both advised corporation officers how to conduct the recall as well as provided conflicting information in a legal DBPR case with an entirely different set of facts and defense due to conflicted dual loyalty that is 100% improper.</li>
    <li>June 06, 2025 Scott Davis immediately files a response to this brief with an exhibit outlining Sarah Webner's own email indicating that 10% homeowner voting interest met the threshold and they acknowledge that as the controlling value. Only after an adverse outcome of the homeowner led recall, 58 days later from that email are they now desperately looking to again find any reason to go against the homeowner will, and majority who pays for the dues that fund the association by funding ridiculous defenses with your money.</li>
    <p><strong>Next Step:</strong> DBPR will evaluate both the homeowner-led recall and the board's petition. A ruling is expected within 7-21 days. If the DBPR certifies the recall, the recalled directors will be removed and replacements will take office.</p>

            <h2>Homeowner Achievement</h2>
            <p>Our community has made incredible progress through lawful homeowner action. Thank you to everyone who participated and supported the effort that is still ongoing. The next step was to file a brief with DBPR with regards to their most recent order today May 30, 2025. The order gives both attorney, Sara Webner and Scott Davis 10 days to file a brief. Scott Davis's brief has already been filed and certification of service sent to attorney Sarah Webner..</p>
