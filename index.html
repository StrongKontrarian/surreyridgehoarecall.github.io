  <h2>üóûÔ∏è Latest Message from Scott Davis</h2>
  
<p>Hi, this is <strong>Scott Davis</strong>, your legally elected HOA VP (post revitalization July 1, 2022 date) and a Certified Pool Operator (CPO) working hard to protect your families, our community assets, prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of your money and to keep your dues from going up.</p>

<p>It's true your dues have been going up ever since the unlawful installation of a few directors on the board who falsified www.sunbiz.org corporate filings listing themselves as installed directors for an association that did not have permission yet to exist to conduct any HOA business. This is potentially a third-degree felony and reason alone for their removal by a homeowner-led special meeting and recall effort.</p>

<p>I'm also a law-abiding citizen that has spent a considerable amount of time and my own money building technologically advanced analysis systems to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs of the association, improve safety, root out corruption, lawbreaking, and willful violations of our own CCR's‚Äîall at zero dollars per hour, and for the benefit of you and your family.</p>

<p>My objective is to bring transparency to illegal board actions & restore transparency in our community. I also want to open up the roster to allow homeowners to have a fair shot at legal appointment or election to be on the board. Over the past few weeks I've met almost every one of you and I appreciate the time you've spent sharing with me about your story here in the community. There's a lot of talented people in here with a lot of skills‚Äîskills that we should be aware of as a Board of Directors so we know who to call on as an advisor that can help us when the time calls.</p>

<p>Some of these skilled individuals might even be interested in serving on the board and donating some of their time in an efficient way to improve the operations of the association and run it like it was meant to be run. Free from drama and contention, with a group of homeowners wanting to do what's best for the community‚Äînot just what's best for themselves. Everyone in the community should have an opportunity to serve on the board if they want to, but it's not required. Service should not be a chore. People with a specialized skillset should have the opportunity to showcase their knowledge for the benefit of the community. I hope you'll help me remove those directors who were improperly installed. We've already collected a major volume of signed proxies authorizing me to go to work on your behalf.</p>

<p>The special notice meeting has been posted at the front of the community. We have met the threshold to request a special meeting, and it has been set for <strong>April 25 at 7 PM at the Cabana</strong> like many of you have asked for. Yes, you heard that right‚Äîwe will have a meeting in person at the Cabana on April 25. A formal notice was posted yesterday at the front of the neighborhood by an officer of the Surrey Ridge Community Association. This is a major meeting for homeowners and requires 14-day notice, which is why it is set on the date that it is. You will also be receiving in the mail a formal notice of this meeting confirming the validity of this procedure. A signed affidavit of mailing has been sent to both the HOA attorney and secretary to confirm it was notarized and sent as required by Florida law.</p>

<p>Any last proxies can be submitted however is easiest for you‚Äîtext, email, DocuSign, mailbox drop-off. Just let me know. I thank everyone for your support, and I look forward to seeing new board applications or even just hearing from those interested in helping.</p>

  <p>I'm working hard to protect your families, our community assets, and to keep your dues from rising through improved operational efficiency and elimination of fraud, waste, and abuse.</p>
  <p>This recall is a legal, homeowner-led effort grounded in Florida Statute 720. Improperly installed board members and illegal vote counts have led to rising dues, preventable expenses, and a lack of transparency.</p>
  <p>We've reached the legal threshold to call a special meeting. That meeting will take place on <strong>April 25, 2025 at 7:00 PM</strong> at the Cabana, just like many of you requested. You‚Äôll also receive formal notices by mail confirming the legal procedure.</p>
  <p>If you have not submitted your proxy, it‚Äôs not too late. You can text, email, drop it off, or request a DocuSign version. Your voice and vote are critical to restoring our community‚Äôs trust and financial health.</p>

  <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 1em; line-height: 2.0;">
    <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> The pool should've been opened three weeks ago.</li>
    <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> The management company, pool vendor, president, and treasurer supported a vendor who sabotaged the pool, causing a <span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$6,000</strong></span> repair and 3-week closure. This adds <strong><span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$44</strong></span></strong> per year to your dues.</li>
    <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> This <span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$6,000</strong></span> repair was entirely preventable and stems from allowing an unlicensed vendor to do plumbing work, in violation of Florida law.</li>
    <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> Morgan Property Solutions was hired illegally. Janelle Marazon counted votes sent to her personal email‚Äîon different days‚Äîwith more votes than voting members. This alone costs you <strong><span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$60.69</strong></span>/year</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> Tom Franzen authorized a <span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$1,050</strong></span> backflow device purchase before our HOA was legally recognized. That device is not even connected to the pool‚Äîit‚Äôs unclear what it protects. That‚Äôs <strong><span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$7.24</strong></span>/year</strong> per homeowner for nothing.</li>
  </ul>
<ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 1em; line-height: 2.0;">
  <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> Tom Franzen authorized a <span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$1,050</strong></span> backflow device purchase before our HOA was legally recognized. That device is not even connected to the pool‚Äîit has one purpose and that's to prevent backfill from the pool water to the freshwater potable water system. However, it's not even connected to that according to Michael's Plumbing. This was just money thrown out the window‚Äîyour money. That‚Äôs <span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$7.24</strong></span>/year per homeowner for nothing. This is why this recall needs to occur.</li>

  <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> Several board members voted for a <span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$1,200</strong></span> invoice from Always Clear, an incompetent pool vendor. Due to my investigation, I found that the vendor was missing one of the two required filters inside the housing‚Äîthis saved each homeowner <span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$8.28</strong></span>/year. <br>

  </li>

  <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> Morgan Property Solutions HOA Dept. spent <span style="color:#ff4c4c;"><strong>$97</strong></span> for a board training course that is available for free from the state of Florida. Another wasteful expense. <br>

  </li>

  <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> On December 4, 2024, President Janelle Marazon asked the board to vote via private email and Google Form on whether she could keep chickens‚Äîdespite this being illegal and against CCRs. <br>
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1336736049103241268/1336736210021781556/image.png?ex=67fb3e5b&is=67f9ecdb&hm=6a79ffb341e8d4122db463dd7cf6c146011cb07724efefda688db6414235bc6d&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1098&height=1556" alt="Chicken Vote Screenshot" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin-top:10px;" />
  </li>

  <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> Your dues keep increasing because President Janelle Marazon is protecting an incompetent management company. In August 2024 she proposed 8%, 12%, or 15% dues increases. <br>
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1349841122892972104/1349841247082119168/Screenshot_2025-03-13_at_4.25.42_PM.png?ex=67fb7560&is=67fa23e0&hm=6764ba0f82841c494f575c3d7ede244a53b59d99e092f0fd1a94ee0752359809&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1631&height=1473" alt="Dues Increase Options" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin-top:10px;" />
  </li>

  <li><strong style="color:#4a90e2;">FACT:</strong> When I countered with a ‚Äúno raise‚Äù option due to 24% delinquency, Janelle tried to block it by instructing board members to respond only to her email and ignore mine‚Äîillegally controlling communications.
