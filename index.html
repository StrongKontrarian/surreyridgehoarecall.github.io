        <h1>🚨 Recall Vote Successful - Certification Improperly Rejected</h1>
        <p>On <strong>April 25, 2025</strong>, Surrey Ridge homeowners overwhelmingly voted to recall President Janelle Marazon, Treasurer Erica Tirado, and Director Tom Franzen.</p>

            <h2>📢 May 1 Certification Meeting — Conflict of Interest Exposed</h2>
            <p>Watch the full meeting where recalled directors improperly voted to reject the certification of their own recall and then made themselves the majority vote in a motion that the recall be rejected, a clear conflict of interest as recognized in multiple DBPR arbitration rulings. Florida administrative code often considers decisive votes on motions to reject recalls that only pass due to the votes of the conflicted individuals being recalled -counting their own votes in the decisive motion, to be invalid. They also attempted to use HOA funds to retain legal counsel without board approval:</p>

            <h2>📋 What Happens Now? (As of May 5, 2025)</h2>
            <p>On May 1, 2025, the recalled board members improperly voted to reject the certification of their own recall. This action violates Florida Statute §720.303(10).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Next Step:</strong> The recalled board members have until <strong>May 8, 2025</strong> (5 business days from the May 1st meeting) to file a Petition for Recall Arbitration with the DBPR if they wish to contest the recall.</li>
                <li><strong>If No Petition Filed by May 8:</strong> The recall becomes effective automatically, and the recalled board members are removed.</li>
                <li><strong>If Petition Filed:</strong> The HOA will likely face significant legal costs (estimated $10,000–$12,000) to defend a lawful recall, potentially leading to a dues increase. DBPR overwhelmingly favors homeowners in properly conducted recalls.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Homeowners should remain vigilant. The outcome now depends on whether the recalled board pursues costly and likely unwinnable arbitration using HOA funds.</p>

            <h2>⚖️ Warning: Potential DBPR Arbitration Costs</h2>
            <p>If the recalled board members choose to file a Petition for Recall Arbitration with the DBPR by the May 8 deadline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>👉 It would cost a $200 filing fee, exposing the HOA to an estimated $10,000–$12,000 in legal fees.</li>
                <li>👉 Defending a recall that complied 100% with Florida law would be virtually unwinnable.</li>
                <li>👉 Homeowners would face an approximate dues increase of $82.76 per household to cover these legal costs.</li>
                <li>👉 Recalled directors may face demands for personal reimbursement if they misuse HOA funds on frivolous litigation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Homeowners will be fully and immediately notified if Association funds are wrongfully used to oppose the recall via arbitration.</strong></p>

            <h2>🛠️ Pool Reopened – Legally and Safely</h2>
            <p>✅ The pool has now legally reopened following a licensed repair, approved by the Florida Department of Health.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✔️ Plumbing repaired by American Veteran Plumbing LLC – a licensed, DBPR-verified CFC contractor.</li>
                <li>✔️ Cost: $295 (vs. $750+ proposal to dig alone by the former vendor)</li>
                <li>✔️ No trenching, no rerouting, no inflated costs</li>
                <li>✔️ DOH approved reopening after full documentation submitted</li>
                <li>✔️ Pool chemical levels verified: pH 7.4, Free Chlorine 7.5 ppm</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>💧 Water restored to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>🏊 Cabana restroom and shower</li>
                <li>🚿 Pool shower and fill line</li>
                <li>🌱 Irrigation (pending one remaining break)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The repair saved thousands in HOA funds and avoided a dues increase. All work was done transparently and lawfully under homeowner proxy authority.</p>
            <p><strong>🚨 Update:</strong> After the satisfactory inspection, President Janelle Marazon attempted to interfere with the Department of Health report by submitting photos and making false claims about unlicensed work. DOH officials Alan Dang and Andrew Halula rejected these claims and confirmed the pool remains open and compliant.</p>
