       <h1>🚨 Recall Vote Certified by Homeowners – Arbitration Pending</h1>
<p>On <strong>April 25, 2025</strong>, Surrey Ridge homeowners voted by a clear majority to recall President Janelle Marazon, Treasurer Erica Tirado, and Director Tom Franzen. The vote count was <strong>81–2</strong> 56% Homeowner Majority in favor of recall.</p>

<section class="highlight-section">
    <h2>📢 May 1 Certification Meeting — Conflict of Interest & Legal Misuse</h2>
    <p>At the May 1, 2025 certification meeting, the three recalled board members improperly voted to reject their own recall—an act <strong>explicitly prohibited</strong> under Florida Statute §720.303(10).</p>
    <p>They also attempted to retain the HOA attorney and use association funds without a properly noticed board vote or D&O insurance in place.</p>

    <h2>📋 What’s Happening Now? (As of May 12, 2025)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>On <strong>May 6, 2025</strong>, the HOA attorney officially filed a Petition for Recall Arbitration with the Florida DBPR to contest the results of the April 25 recall.</li>
        <li>Vice President Scott Davis, the designated proxy holder for 81 homeowners, submitted an immediate formal response to DBPR opposing the petition.</li>
        <li>The HOA currently has <strong>no Directors & Officers (D&O) insurance coverage</strong>. All board actions since May 10 are exposing directors to personal liability.</li>
        <li>As of May 12, legal fees already exceed <strong>$1,875</strong>, with potential costs estimated at <strong>$10,000–$15,000</strong> if arbitration continues frivolously.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> The recall remains valid, and recalled directors are placeholders while the recall is under DBPR review. If the DBPR rules in favor of homeowners, the recalled directors will be permanently removed and replaced by the elected recall replacements of homeowners who supported the recall voting on new board members. A final decision is expected within 10–45 days.</p>

    <h2>🧾 Financial Watch: Homeowners Paying for the Recalled Board’s Legal Defense</h2>
    <p>The recalled board members are using HOA dues to fund their personal legal defense in an arbitration case they are statistically likely to lose.</p>
    <p>This raises serious concerns about continued misuse of funds, lack of transparency, and violation of homeowner rights.</p>
</section>

<section class="highlight-section">
    <h2>📅 Stay Informed — Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>📬 Homeowners will be notified by email and posted notices as soon as DBPR issues a ruling.</li>
        <li>🗳️ If the recall is upheld, replacement directors (including the current Vice President) will immediately take office.</li>
        <li>💬 A community-wide update meeting will be scheduled after DBPR resolution.</li>

            <h2>⚖️ Warning: Potential DBPR Arbitration Costs</h2>
            <p>If the recalled board members choose to file a Petition for Recall Arbitration with the DBPR by the May 8 deadline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>👉 It would cost a $200 filing fee, exposing the HOA to an estimated $10,000–$12,000 in legal fees.</li>
                <li>👉 Defending a recall that complied 100% with Florida law would be virtually unwinnable.</li>
                <li>👉 Homeowners would face an approximate dues increase of $82.76 per household to cover these legal costs.</li>
                <li>👉 Recalled directors may face demands for personal reimbursement if they misuse HOA funds on frivolous litigation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Homeowners will be fully and immediately notified if Association funds are wrongfully used to oppose the recall via arbitration.</strong></p>

            <h2>🛠️ Pool Reopened – Legally and Safely</h2>
            <p>✅ The pool has now legally reopened following a licensed repair, approved by the Florida Department of Health.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✔️ Plumbing repaired by American Veteran Plumbing LLC – a licensed, DBPR-verified CFC contractor.</li>
                <li>✔️ Cost: $295 (vs. $750+ proposal to dig alone by the former vendor)</li>
                <li>✔️ No trenching, no rerouting, no inflated costs</li>
                <li>✔️ DOH approved reopening after full documentation submitted</li>
                <li>✔️ Pool chemical levels verified: pH 7.4, Free Chlorine 7.5 ppm</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>💧 Water restored to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>🏊 Cabana restroom and shower</li>
                <li>🚿 Pool shower and fill line</li>
                <li>🌱 Irrigation (pending one remaining break)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The repair saved thousands in HOA funds and avoided a dues increase. All work was done transparently and lawfully under homeowner proxy authority.</p>
            <p><strong>🚨 Update:</strong> After the satisfactory inspection, President Janelle Marazon attempted to interfere with the Department of Health report by submitting photos and making false claims about unlicensed work. DOH officials Alan Dang and Andrew Halula rejected these claims and confirmed the pool remains open and compliant.</p>
